# Commands

This directory contains macros that define various commands you can use in World of Warcraft. Each command is designed to perform specific tasks that can enhance your gameplay. Below is a description of each command available in this directory:

### 1. `/accountbars`
Sets up action bars with abilities that are the same for all your characters, such as hearthstones, mounts, utilities, and profession abilities. This command helps standardize certain abilities across multiple characters.

### 2. `/clearloadouts`
Deletes all the talent loadouts saved on your character. Use this command when you want to clear out old or unused loadouts.

### 3. `/clearmacros`
Deletes all the character-specific macros of the current character. This is useful for cleaning up or resetting macros for a specific character.

### 4. `/clearquests`
Deletes all quests except campaign quests. This command can help you quickly clear your quest log of non-essential quests.

### 5. `/loadloadouts`
Loads all the saved loadouts for the current spec. Use this command to quickly apply previously saved loadouts, ensuring consistency across your characters of the same class and spec.

### 6. `/loadmacros`
Loads all the saved macros for the current class. This allows you to quickly load a set of macros tailored to your class, simplifying setup on new characters or after a reset.

### 7. `/macroicon <macro_name> <icon_name>`
Allows you to set the icon for a macro using its name and the icon name from [Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/icons). This command makes it easy to customize macro icons for better visual organization.

### 8. `/saveloadout`
Saves the current loadout to be loaded by `/loadloadouts` on other characters of the same class and spec. This command helps you maintain consistency across different characters.

### 9. `/savemacros`
Saves all the character macros to be loaded by other characters of the same class. This is useful for sharing a consistent set of macros across multiple characters.

### 10. `/way <x> <y>`
Creates a waypoint, similar to how TomTom works. Note that the game only allows one waypoint at a time, and you must be on the correct map for the coordinates to work correctly. This command is helpful for navigating to specific locations.
