# Command Libraries

This directory contains supplementary files that support the macros in the `cmds` directory. These files are used when a command requires more than 255 characters to function correctly.

No individual file descriptions are provided here, as these files are meant to complement and extend the functionality of the main command macros in the `cmds` directory.
